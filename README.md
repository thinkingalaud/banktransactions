Chrome extension to scrape bank transactions

I like to merge all my transactions into a single spreadsheet in a format similar to credit card transactions (positive means a charge/payment, negative means a refund/income, etc)

I didn't want to trust anyone else with reading my bank transactions, so I wrote this tool for myself. I don't know why you would want to use this if you are not me. I'm a stranger that can read your bank transactions!
